cg.m : This script takes in protein structures from the protein data bank and create a coarse grain respresentation using kmeans clustering.

concentrationscaler.m : This script takes in coarse grain structures, and scales them by their biological concentrations

pymol_3.m : This script allows for visualization of the model biological cell using pymol.
